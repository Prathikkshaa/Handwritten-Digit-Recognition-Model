# Handwritten Digit Recognition with CNN

## Data Loading and Preprocessing:

- The code loads the MNIST dataset, containing images of handwritten digits and their corresponding labels.
- Pixel values of the images are normalized to a range between 0 and 1 to stabilize the training process.
- Input images are reshaped to include a channel dimension, necessary for convolutional layers.
- Labels are one-hot encoded to convert categorical labels into a binary matrix representation.
- Training data is shuffled to ensure randomness, and the dataset is split into training, validation, and testing sets.

## Model Architecture Definition and Compilation:

- A Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model is defined using the Keras Sequential API.
- The model architecture includes convolutional layers followed by max-pooling layers and dense layers for classification.
- The model is compiled with appropriate settings such as the optimizer, loss function, and evaluation metric.

## Training the Model:

- The model is trained using the fit() method with the training data and validation data.
- The number of epochs and batch size are specified to control the training process.
- Training history is collected to monitor the model's performance during training.

## Model Evaluation and Visualization:

- The trained model is evaluated using the testing dataset to compute loss and accuracy.
- Training history (loss and accuracy) is visualized using Matplotlib to understand the training progress and identify overfitting or underfitting.

## Saving and Loading the Model:

- The trained model is saved to a file for future use without retraining.
- The model can be loaded from the saved file using load_model() for making predictions or further training.

## Predictions and Comparison:

- Predictions are generated for the test dataset using the trained model.
- Predicted labels are compared with actual labels to assess the model's performance.

## Interactive Image Prediction Display:

- A GUI is created using Tkinter for interactive handwritten digit recognition.
- Users can upload an image, and the model makes predictions on the uploaded image, displaying the results on the GUI.
